## How can I know this module is not a backdoor?

A backdoor is a server-side script whose goal usually is to allow exploiters to execute server-side code in your game.
There is no way for this module to do that if you only initialize it on the client.

## How performant is the emit module?

I try to make the module have as little impact on performance as possible by using optimization tactics such as [object pooling](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object_pool_pattern) and bulk CFrame movement.
If you want to improve the performance of the module, contributions to the GitHub [repository](https://github.com/zilibobi/forge-vfx/) are always welcome.
