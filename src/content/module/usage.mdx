## Initialization

The module has a very simple interface. All you need to do to get started is initialize the module on the client:

```luau filename="initialize.client.luau"
local ReplicatedStorage = game:GetService("ReplicatedStorage")

local vfx = require(ReplicatedStorage.ForgeVFX) -- Replace with the path to wherever you put the module

vfx.init()
```

To stop the module, call the `deinit` method.

```luau filename="initialize.client.luau"
vfx.deinit()
```

---

You can also optionally initialize the module on the server.
All it does is create the collision groups ussed by certain effects.

Check the [replication example](../examples/basic_replication) for a simple replication setup.

## Usage

After initializing, you can call the `emit` method and pass the effects you want to emit to it.

```luau filename="initialize.client.luau"
vfx.emit(workspace.Effect)
```

This method returns an object describing the status of the emit request:

```luau filename="initialize.client.luau"
local env = vfx.emit(workspace.Effect)

env.Finished:finally(function()
  print("effect finished emitting!")
end)
```

```luau
type env = {
  Finished: Promise,
}
```

The module is also exposed inside `shared.vfx`, so you can do this in another script:

```luau filename="effects.client.luau"
local ReplicatedStorage = game:GetService("ReplicatedStorage")

local Effects = ReplicatedStorage:WaitForChild("VFX")

shared.vfx.emit(Effects.Explosion, Effects.Wind)
```
